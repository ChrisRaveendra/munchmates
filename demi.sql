My love for cooking started at a young age in my motherland of Iran, when I used to watch my mom cook for our family of six and endless more guests! She taught me to cook with passion and educate myself about the healing power of food and herbs. To this day, healthy eating habits play an important role in my cooking and personal lifestyle. We had a beautiful tradition at home of making our own delicate pastries for the Persian New Year, Nowruz, marking the first day of Spring. Family and friends simply loved it, and we loved spreading the joy! I’ve had the chance to explore and share my cooking and baking skills since then. When I was 16, I volunteered to help raise money by hand-making high quality sweets and treats for charities and non-profit organizations. I always enjoyed doing such projects alongside my studies and work, especially for a good cause. My style of cooking is influenced as much by my Persian roots as my travels in other countries. I’ve had the pleasure of exploring different cuisines during trips across Europe, such as in Paris where I took classes at the Cordon Bleu. I believe travel, people and food open doors to different cultures and I truly feel lucky to be able to experience that endless journey of discovery.Living in San Francisco has been yet another fantastic experience. With a professional background in computer Eng. and business, I’ve worked with high tech startups here in the Bay Area, mainly dealing with technology gadgets like augmented reality glasses and product management. I enjoy extensive knowledge about branding and advertising from my time working and studying in Dubai, a global melting pot, which also opened many doors for me to Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine.I’m excited above all to share the fruits of my global cooking adventures with you, including unique culinary gems of my beloved Iran. Noosh e joon.

Geoff got his first taste of the culinary life at 12, helping with chocolate dipped strawberries and washing dishes on Valentine’s Day at a restaurant where his older brother worked.

One day, I stopped mid bite and wondered how they were made. That led me to become wonderfully curious about how chocolates were made into perfect little shapes and why they tasted so good.  I began a quest to figure it out and also make the freshest chocolate truffles without preservatives.  At 18, I started experimenting with chocolate truffles and at 19 my sister and I launched Socola Chocolatier at a farmer’s market in Santa Rosa.  I graduated from UC Davis and went to Pastry School in the evenings while I spent 8-years in Management Consulting. In 2012 I took the leap and pursued my dream of opening a Chocolate Shop full time and have not looked back since.

Geoff got his first taste of the culinary life at 12, helping with chocolate dipped strawberries and washing dishes on Valentine’s Day at a restaurant where his older brother worked.
